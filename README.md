This is my project for a Algorithms and Data Structures.

The problem to resolve was a auto parking system.

The first problem to resolve was which data structure to use?
    In this topic we choosed linked list, the parking cant be infinite.
    With the linked list we get on average :
        - Acess: O(n)
        - Search: O(n)
        - Insertion: O(1)
        - Deletion: O(1)
    We have a nice response times for eveything.

In second place which sorting algorithms are we using to implement in the project?
    In this section I thought in make a option to order all the cars in data structure by coordinates.
    When we insert a car in the parking he just goes to the linked list, so for better performance order its good.
